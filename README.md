# Cpp_Snippet
This repository contains small C++ programs in Visual Studio project style in order to help learning the logic of this programming language.

### 01-Basic Folder
This folder contains examples on basic concepts of C++ programming like: loops, functions, pointers, structures etc. All programs (`Console App`) in this page are tested and verified in Visual Studio.
